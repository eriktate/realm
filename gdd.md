# REALM

## Story
You are a skilled adventurer looking to settle down. You build a small home and start to take in random travellers and building your village. This life isn't easy, though. As you grow your village, you'll also garner more attention. Monsters and rival villages will start to fight you for resources, and it's up to you to ensure the safety and prosperity of your own realm.

## Characters
### Playable
#### Warrior
With high defense and short range attacks, warriors typically get right in the middle of the action. Since they fight alongside their troops, they can rally them together and buff various stats.
#### Mage
Mages are more fragile than warriors, but can unleash mid-range, AOE attacks. They typically fight from behind their troops, providing support and damage output.

#### Hunter
Hunters are sturdy, long range attackers. They're good at single target damage from a safe distance, so they often pick off stronger monsters from behind their troops. In addition to long range, they have an array of traps that they can lay.

#### Rogue
Rogue's are fast and sneaky. They have high crit chance and get bonus damage when attacking if not seen.

### Friendly
#### Villager
A villager just lives in your village. They don't really do much except eat your food and use up a spare bed, give them something to do!

#### Laborer
A laborer does all kinds of manual labor. They can cut down trees, mine resources, transport things. If it's a brawny job, the laborer can do it.

#### Craftsman
A craftsman can take your raw materials and turn them into something useful. Craftsman build houses, weapons, tools, and lots of other cool stuff.

#### Farmer
A farmer produces all sorts of resources for your village, most important of which is food.

#### Soldier
A soldier fights for the village. Whether that be patroling and defending the walls, or going on expeditions.

### Monsters
#### Slimes
Slimes are the weakest of the monsters. Their bodies are made up of a powerful acid which can injure you if touched. Other than that, they mostly just bounce around.

#### Newts
Newts are primitive humanoid lizard people. They live in wild villages and can fashion rudimentary weapons. They're more dangerous than slimes, but not very smart.

#### Stalkers
Stalkers only attack at night. They're much stronger and smarter than your typical daytime monster and soldier's shouldn't fight them alone.

## Environment
Environment changes slightly based on which faction's realm you start in. The world is a large, open, procedurally generated sandbox. There are caves and dungeons to explore throughout the map and some areas are only accessible with boats. The day/night cycle determine what enemeies and resources spawn, as well as when certain events happen.
